## Jenkins pipeline job
### Stage1: Checkout
Jenkins pipeline checks out the merge of branches from Github hook and stores the code into working file. And  it passes the image tag from checkout to the following stages.

### Stage2: Docker Build
Docker builds a new image with updated code and push it into AWS ECRÂ .

### Stage3: Deploy in k8s with Helm
Use Ansible to call Helm chart to deploy the image which contains the code of helloworld from AWS ECR into Kubernetes pods.
